NeonGrid: Cyberpunk Hack Hunt
NeonGrid: Cyberpunk Hack Hunt is a futuristic, cyberpunk-themed interactive hacking puzzle game. It challenges players to solve riddles and coding problems while immersing them in a neon-lit hacking world.

The project is implemented as:

A web-based front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an animated, sound-enhanced interactive experience.

A Python CLI (command-line interface) version that recreates the same game logic with text animations and user input prompts, perfect for terminal play.

Python CLI Overview
The Python script uses timed text printing (delay_print) to simulate typing, and presents 8 clues related to cyberpunk, logic, and Python programming. The player inputs answers for each clue, and the script evaluates correctness, keeping score. At the end, it provides a success or failure message based on the player’s performance.

This combination showcases how the same game concept can be delivered both as a web app and a console app, using complementary technologies.
